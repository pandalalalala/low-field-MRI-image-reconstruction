# low-field-MRI-image-reconstruction

main_solve_eqns.m starts from defining our FOV in X, Y matrices (assuming the initial position of Halbach array is upwards), and therefore the encoding matrix will be determined according to the FOV.

enc_gen.m functions to generate this encoding matrix, while using the newly measured B0 field (B0_complete_measurement.mat) and CoilBiotSavart_SUTD2018.m.

In the meantime, a phantom image is prepared, by import_images_june_2018.m, it obtains images from a specified folder.

With the encoding matrix E generated by enc_gen.m, and the reshaped image m, we can calculate the simulated signal S using sig_gen_simul.m, it simply multiplies two matrices.

LSMethod.m, Kaczmarz_su.m, TSVD.m are in sequence the functions of three method (lease square, iteration and TSVD), these three take nearly same input and generate output in the same format, so we can replace one with another easily.

NOTE that there are a few functions based on GPU calculating, which require NVIDIA cards.

Then add_noise.m is used to give a noise to the signal simulated from sig_gen_simul.m, and now our signal is with noise.
